Hello friend and welcome to my personal project playground! :)
This blog mainly serves me as a documentation platform to figureout what notions brought me to build certain projects.

Since I am very much interested in web automation, this blog will mainly deal about such topics. But as we are all interested in cool new technologies, programming languages and awesome memes, I won't limit myself to certain topics.

Just want to learn new things and try to evolve over time.

...oh and please don't get disturbed by any werid looking ":w" within the text...this is because of vim and my bad that I yet another time forgot to escape the INSERT mode ;P
